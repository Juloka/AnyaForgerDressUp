## Description
For my final prject in Programming for Digital Artists, I was tasked to create a game or art using all the Python coding skills I learned throughout this semester. I was also allowed to use outside sources to help me. I will provide those in this description. 

My first function was the catrgory buttons that displayed on the game window. I did a lot of research to find the best way to code this the way it would work for me. I used this article from *The Python Code*:

https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-button-using-pygame-in-python

This article showed me step by step on how to create buttons. It explained in detail on what each line of code meant. I also used this video to help me visualize more what the code was going to do. This video is by the user *ProgrammingKnowledge*:

This video was a great visual from the article, because she was actually showing the audience what the game window looked like after each save.

My second function was the different option buttons appearing when a certain category button was clicked on. I had to dig deep on Google to find a website that could help me with my code. This page from the offical *pygame* website helped me.

https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/mouse.html

This page helped me because I learned what pygame.mouse is and how it use it in my game. The examples were also very very helpful in understanding how to implement pygame.mouse in my code.

The last function was the download option in my game window. 

If I have time, I will also need to research the best way to download an image of the outfit to the computer. This will be researched last.
