## Description
For my final prject in Programming for Digital Artists, I was tasked to create a game or art using all the Python coding skills I learned throughout this semester. I was also allowed to use outside sources to help me. I will provide those in this description. 

My first function was the catrgory buttons that displayed on the game window. I did a lot of research to find the best way to code this the way it would work for me. I used this article from *The Python Code*:

https://thepythoncode.com/article/make-a-button-using-pygame-in-python

This article showed me step by step on how to create buttons. It explained in detail on what each line of code meant. I also used this video to help me visualize more what the code was going to do. This video is by the user *ProgrammingKnowledge*:

This video was a great visual from the article, because she was actually showing the audience what the game window looked like after each save.

My second function was the different option buttons appearing when a certain category button was clicked on.

I will need to research on how I can make "buttons" in my game. This is the first topic that needs to be researched.
I will also need to research how to change the options when the player clicks on a specific category. This will be researched second.
If I have time, I will also need to research the best way to download an image of the outfit to the computer. This will be researched last.
