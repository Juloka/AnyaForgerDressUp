# Anya Forger Dress Up Game Proposal

## Repository
https://github.com/Juloka/AnyaForgerDressUp.git

## Description
A very simple dress up game featuring Anya Forger from SpyXFamily. This is relevant to media and digital arts because this will bring together digital art and fashion through code.

## Features
- Feature 1: Categories
	- Every dress up game has many catagories of clothing/makeup for the model to where. I plan on excuting the cataegories by coding the "buttons" to open up the options under the catgories.
- Feature 2: Options
	- Every dress up game also has many options of clothing/makeup to choose from. I plan on excuting the options by coding the "buttons" to open up the art on the model.
- Feature 3: Save Outfit Option
	- Most dress up games also hae the opyion to save your outfit to the computer as a jpg or png. I plan on excuting this save option by coding the save "button" to save the model on the computer as a jpg or png.

## Challenges
- I will need to research on how I can make "buttons" in my game. This is the first topic that needs to be researched.
- I will also need to research how to change the options when the player clicks on a specific category. This will be researched second.
- If I have time, I will also need to research the best way to save an image of the outfit to the computer. This will be researched last.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- All options/catagories work when clicking on the icons

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- If only one option from each catagory works, this will make me very proud of myself.
